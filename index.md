I am Borgmon. A full stack developer. I enjoy creating data flow. From front-end to backend, through load balancer, they are transformed via immutable stream and saved to database. They are bouncing bits, they can be traced, be visualized, and be studied. Iâ€™m looking forward to engineer on those bouncing bits for your business.
