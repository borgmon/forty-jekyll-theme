This game was created in 48h in the GameJam 2017(GDC). We must make a game in 2 days without using any old assets. We have 7 people in our group, including 3d modeler, musician, level design. I’m the chief programmer and it’s my honor work with those great people we never meet before.
This is a fast paced first person shooter game. In this game, player will make their way to revenge by killing groups of enemies. 
The game won the Best Creative. You can require a copy by contact me.
