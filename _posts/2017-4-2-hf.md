This is a mobile VR game using cardboard SDK. Player will explore the dark forest full of creatures. Along the path, they will face puzzles and beasts. I was trying to discover a new way to interact with game by using microphone. Player have to yelling in real life in order to scare away wolfs.
The project was completed in 2 weeks by myself. The game was originally published for iPhone. You can require a copy by contact me.
